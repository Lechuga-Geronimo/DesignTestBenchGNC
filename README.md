# Characterization, Design, Development and Simulation of a Test Bench for the Validation of Control Systems for CubeSat Satellites
Project to design a test platform to suspend a satellite, for recreating the low-friction conditions they are subjected in space and to test ADCS performance of CubeSat. 

## Year: 2021 - 2022.

## Abstract. 

The Control Algorithm is a constitutive and indispensable part of the Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS) in air- and spacecraft, including rockets, probes, and other vehicles; such satellites.

The correct operation of the Control Algorithm is extremely important for the missionâ€™s success. The useful life of the satellite and the fulfillment of its objectives will depend on it. For this reason, and considering the development of satellite technology in CubeSat-type nanosatellites that is being carried out at the [REDACTED], it is essential to have a Test Bench for orientation and stability control systems for satellites, where a CubeSat prototype equipped with an ADCS can be tested, based on the international standards used by the main world space agencies such as NASA, ESA, JAXA, etc.

In addition to the technological development that this project implies, its benefit will not only increase the capacity and infrastructures installed in the [REDACTED], but will also allow students and teachers to validate their work focused on the field of satellite ADCS development for CubeSats, as well as in the future, the [REDACTED] will offer these services to external agents to the [REDACTED].
